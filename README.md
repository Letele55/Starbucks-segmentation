## Background
This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

1.Customer Profiles: Contains details about customers, including their age, gender, income, and the date they became members.

2.Portfolio: Lists the offers sent to customers during a 30-day test period. These offers were delivered through various channels such as web, email, mobile, or social media, either individually or in combination. The offers vary in difficulty (minimum spend required) and reward, and are categorized into three types: Discount, Buy-One-Get-One (BOGO), and Informational.

3.Transcript: Records all interactions with offers (receiving, viewing, completing) and other transactions made during the test period.

## Installation
Run with Python 3 with libraries of numpy, pandas, and json

## Recommendation

Segmentation 1 
Customers in this age range 18-34 receive regular BOGO offers with low engagement, and practically no discount offers. These BOGO offers involve more valuable rewards this will increase their conversion rate and there give higher spend.
Normally when this age group sees somthing free they normally buy

Segmentation 2
Male Customers normally do not convert to the offers send to them so making a segment for them which is a happy hour lower discount 50% to the best drink on fridays at 6 A.M this will increase their spend and they will now come to buy next time when they have tested the best.

Segmentation 3
Females are very particular having personalised message because they buy off emotions, so grate a social experience outside of just drink, for example give them a free yoga class once a month.
